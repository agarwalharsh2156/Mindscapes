# Mindscapes

A project aiming towards supporting individuals in their tough times by listening them.

The best way to relieve yourself from your grief is to let your emotions step out of your heart. Speaking it to someone who listens is the best method for that.

It offers you to book a Calendly session with one of our trained listeners, who are ever ready to listen to you.

`#we listen and we don't judge`

Calendly can seemlesly integrate with your Google Calendar and offers you to schedule meetings and join through your desired platforms like `Zoom` and `Google Meet`
